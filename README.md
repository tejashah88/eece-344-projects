# EECE 344 Projects
Lab projects for CSU Chico State's EECE-344 (Digital Systems Design) class

## Lab Project Structure
Each lab project has a `Documentation` folder which (mostly) includes the following:
- Lab Handout Requirements
- Circuit Schematic
- Program Flowchart
- Circuit Picture

All projects are compiled using C90 mode without GNU extensions (although the Keil compiler does have some extras like slash comments) and all warnings are enabled (that is according to Keil).

## Learning resources
I took this class as of Fall 2024 and while the lectures and textbook are pretty good, I personally found the guides from [microcontrollerslab.com](https://microcontrollerslab.com/) to help a lot as supplemental information, especially with their diagrams and code examples. If you're studying for yourself, I do think the guides can get you a lot of headway on their own.
